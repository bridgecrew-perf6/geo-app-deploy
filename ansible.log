The error appears to be in '/root/ansible/play.yml': line 9, column 8, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with
missing quotes. Always quote template expression brackets when they
start a value. For instance:

    with_items:
      - {{ foo }}

Should be written as:

    with_items:
      - "{{ foo }}"
